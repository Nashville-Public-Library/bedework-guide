# Image Guidelines
If there is an existing graphic / logo (story time, studio, etc.), use the established image as the thumbnail image in Bedework. Please don’t create a new image.

Use the spreadsheet by going to Click here to choose from the library of images. You will have to use your keyboard shortcuts to copy (CTRL+C) / paste (CTRL+V) the links in the table into the Image URL and Thumbnail URL spaces. The links will begin `/public/img/`. If there is not an existing graphic, you may create an image for the thumbnail graphic in Bedework.
- Calendar approvers will review the image.
- Images submitted with events may be removed, remade, or replaced, at the approver’s discretion.
- Accepted images will be added to the Images Spreadsheet accessible from the Bedework entry form for re-use next quarter.

## Size and Text Specifications

- 	Max width: 450px
- 	Max height: 650px
- Thumbnail is automatically created when you upload an image. You may also create a separate thumbnail image. If you want to use a separate thumbnail image, email the images to Web Services and we’ll add them for you.
- Do not leave white space around the image. White space is added automatically by the calendar stylesheet.
-	Words in icon-type images (“Movie Friday” or “Chocolate Worms”) should be readable at thumbnail-size, which is 80px wide.
