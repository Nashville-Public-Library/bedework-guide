## Using Images From Other Websites

- If you find an image you like on a non-library website, look for copyright info for images. Ask the site owner for permission to use their image.

- When using an image from a non-library source, DO NOT use the “Add Media from URL” option. After properly resizing the image, save it and upload it.
