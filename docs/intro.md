# Before You Begin
- Always check the events calendar before adding an event to make sure the event is not already listed.
- Only add events to Bedework if they are confirmed.
- Add recurring events in three month periods matching publishing cycle (Dec Jan Feb, Mar Apr May, Jun Jul Aug, Sept Oct Nov).
    -	For example, if you have a story time that happens every Wednesday, you'll add that event to Bedework as 4 recurring event series (one DecJanFeb listing, one MarAprMay listing, one JunJulAug listing, and one SepOctNov listing).
    - Do not add events scheduled more than nine months out.
