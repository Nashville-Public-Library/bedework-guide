# Topical Areas

Topical areas allow users to find events with the calendar filters (on the left side of the public calendar).

##	Audience (Age)

Select ONE AGE GROUP that best describes your target audience. Multiple age group tagging in Bedework is an extremely rare exception (Seniors and Teens Card Game Night). Do not add multiple audience range tags in Bedework simply to indicate that all are welcome. Add details about the intended audience in Description field.
  -	Children
      -	Use when the majority of the audience will be comprised of Children.
      - Use whenever a program might be of interest to a parent/guardian bringing a child to the library, even when it is not specifically aimed at children. For example, the Scottish Heritage Festival.
  -	Teen
      - Use ONLY when the program has been planned with a teen audience in mind.
      - These programs specifically discourage including children and adults – to create camaraderie among young adults.
      -	DO NOT use simply because an entry has said ‘All ages are welcome’.
      -	Do not use simply because another branch has held the same program for teens. Each library has a different clientele and programming agenda.
  -	Adults
      - Use for events intended for an adult audience. Use to indicate that adults are welcome.

## Locations Checkboxes
-	Select your location if the event is at your branch OR if the event is off-site, but sponsored by your branch, or takes place nearby.
-	Do not select a location if your branch didn’t coordinate the event or guest.
- For online programs, add ‘Online’ tag. Also, add the location responsible for the event.
