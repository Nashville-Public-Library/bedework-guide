# Description
Entries that do not meet these criteria will be rewritten. Whenever possible, use titles and descriptions from past events in the web calendar.

## Order of Details

1. Brief description
1. Age (or school grade) range of intended audience (required for all Children and Teen events)
1. Registration information, if needed

## Writing Style
Describe what to expect at program – set user expectations about the event. Begin descriptions with what the guest will do and/or discuss. Avoid long passages of names or credentials—a single sentence is sufficient. Use short sentences that convey one idea apiece.

Focus on a call to action/invitation.
    - YES: Come make a pine cone birdhouse with us, then take it home with you.
    - NO: Participants will learn to make a birdhouse out of pinecones. Participants will take their birdhouses home with them.

Use appropriate calls to action (CTAs), and vary them appropriately.  Don’t use “Join us...” for everything.
    - Visit, Don’t miss, Drop by, Come see, Learn, Make

Use present tense in descriptions, not future tense. Present tense is appropriate in the online events calendar contexts.  
    - YES: We dance, play, and sing.
    - NO: We will dance, play and sing.
    - YES: Jane Doe presents
    - NO: Jane Doe will present

Use active voice; avoid passive voice whenever possible.
    - YES: Tori demonstrates how to make a kite.
    - NO: Kite making is explained by Tori.
    - YES: Our guest speaker discusses the history of music in Nashville.
    - NO: The history of music in Nashville is discussed by our guest.

Use good keywords. Name items to be discussed. All book sales should have the words "book sale" in the description.
    - eBooks
    - Microsoft Word
    - Gardening

## Common Errors
- Don't include a recurrence pattern (e.g., “Every Tuesday”) in your event descriptions.
- Don't include event times in the description field.  
- Don't include the branch name in the description field, e.g. “please call the Boisterous Branch to register” or “Come to the Boisterous Branch…”. This is redundant information in web events calendar context.
- Don't use "Call for more information." If there is any more information about the event, include it.
-	Don’t use special characters in titles. ``(& ` ~ @)``
