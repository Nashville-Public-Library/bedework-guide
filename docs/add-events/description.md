# Description
-	Consult the Nashville Public Library Style Guide as you craft your titles and descriptions. Entries that do not meet these criteria will be rewritten.
-	Whenever possible, use titles and descriptions from past events in the web calendar.

## Avoid these Common Errors
- Do not include a recurrence pattern (e.g., “Every Tuesday”) in your event descriptions.
- Do not include event times in the description field.  
- Do not include the branch name in the description field, e.g. “please call the Boisterous Branch to register” or “Come to the Boisterous Branch…”. This is redundant information in both Unbound and web events calendar contexts, and could push you over the character limit.
- Do not use "Call for more information." If there is more information about the event, include it in the description, or include a URL for referral.
-	Don’t use special characters (& ` ~ @) in titles.

## Order of Details
Use this order for information in descriptions:
- Brief description
- Age or school grade range of intended audience as appropriate (required for all Children and Teen events--see Standard Usage - Age Ranges section)
- Registration information, if needed
- Describe what to expect at program – set user expectations about the event.
- Whenever possible, limit descriptions to 250 characters or less.
- Avoid overly formal, stilted language, e.g., “Participants will…” or “Attendees will…”. Instead, phrase more conversationally, with a focus on the call to action/invitation.
    - YES: Come make a pine cone birdhouse with us, then take it home with you.
    - NO: Participants will learn to make a birdhouse out of pinecones. Participants will take their birdhouses home with them.
- Use present tense in descriptions, NOT future tense.  Present tense usually requires fewer words, helps avoid passive voice, and is appropriate in both Unbound and online events calendar contexts.
    -YES: We dance, play, and sing
    - NO: We will dance, play and sing
    - YES: Jane Doe presents
    - NO: Jane Doe will present
        - Use active voice; avoid passive voice whenever possible.
    - YES: Tori demonstrates how to make a kite.
    - NO: Kite making is explained by Tori.
    - YES: Our guest speaker discusses the history of music in Nashville.
    - NO: The history of music in Nashville is discussed by our guest.
    - YES: Use found objects and materials in a craft project.
    - NO: Found objects and materials are used in the craft.
    - YES: Nashville Ballet performs classic dances.
    - NO: Classic dances are performed by the Nashville Ballet.
- Use good keywords in your descriptions and titles. For instance, if your program will show off eBooks, use "eBooks" in your description or title. This helps people discover your program using search in the events calendar.
    - eBooks
    - Microsoft Word
    - Gardening
- All book sales should have the words "book sale" in the description.
- Any eBook event should have the word "eBook” in the description.
- Use appropriate calls to action (CTAs), and vary them appropriately, i.e., don’t use “Join us...” for everything. Some other CTAs are:
    - Visit
    - Don’t miss
    - Drop by
    - Come see
    - Learn
    - Make

## Featured Guests
Begin descriptions with what the guest will do and/or discuss. Avoid long descriptions of credentials or publishing history—a single sentence is sufficient. Descriptions should pertain to the activity, not the featured guest of the activity. If it is a Mark Twain lecture, talk about the lecture itself, not Mark Twain, the humorist. Narrative introductions of Twain are inappropriate.

- Good Example:

  Presenter JP Plumlee covers the basics of solar, including: how solar works, solar equipment, roof and shade requirements, and reasons Nashvillians are installing solar on their homes and businesses.
- Good Example:

  T.C. Boyle, author of When the Killing's Done, discusses his newest novel at our Salon@615 series.
- Bad Example (does not set expectations for event)

  Willie Perdomo is the author of Postcards of El Barrio (Isla Negra Press, 2002) and Where A Nickel Costs A Dime (Norton, 1996), as well as Visiting Langston, a picture book illustrated by Bryan Collier.
