# Recurrence Pattern

## Guidelines
- **Do not include recurrence pattern in the description field.** This goes only in the recurrence pattern field.
- Use 3 letter abbreviation for months: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
- Use entire word for days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.
- Do not use a period at the end of the field.
- Cross-reference events that have multiple times/dates.
    - List “Citizenship Class with Nashville Adult Literacy Council, Every Monday and Tuesday, 10:00 AM-12:30 PM, and 5:45 PM-7:30 PM” in the recurrence pattern field for citizenship classes that happen on multiple dates and times.  
- Only include times in the Recurrence Patterns text field if the same event occurs at multiple times on the same day.
    - List “Every Tuesday at 9:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM” in the recurrence pattern field for story times that have multiple showings per day.

## Add Recurrence Pattern (Required)
![img "recurrence pattern"](../../src/img/recurrence-pattern-field.jpg)
- When viewed in the events calendar, the text from the Recurrence Pattern field will display as the first sentence in your description.

**Recurrence Pattern is required for all repeating events.** If you leave this field blank, we will not approve your event.
1.	Select `event recurs` to bring up the recurrence menu.
1.	Type the recurrence pattern in the Recurrence Pattern field.

## Listing Exceptions
- ONLY list exception dates if there is no “replacement” event occurring on the same day and time as the regular program, for the same age group.
    - List “Every Tuesday except Sep 5” for Preschool Story Time if there will be no story time, featured guest, or other event for preschool children to attend on that day and time.
- DO NOT list exceptions for events that fall on days NPL is closed (e.g., do not list “Every Tuesday except Jul 4”).
- DO NOT list exceptions when a regularly recurring event is replaced by a featured performer for one (or more) weeks in an events period.
    - do NOT list “Every Tuesday except Jun 6, Jul 11, Aug 8” for Preschool Story Time if Nashville Ballet, Mr. Bond and The Science Guys, and Nashville Zoo events are happening at the same time on those three days.
