## Fine Print

These events DO get added to Bedework (NPL Public Events Calendar):
-	Events planned by government agencies and open to the public.
-	Events planned in conjunction with NPL staff. When Nashville Public Library is a co-sponsor, or has arranged the event for the library patronage. Library logos should only go on Library sponsored or co-sponsored events. Having an event at the Library or the Library sharing information about an event does not necessarily equal Library sponsorship or co-sponsorship. If you have questions about whether an event is sponsored or co-sponsored by NPL, ask your manager.
-	Other ‘open to the public’ events, at Library Administrator’s discretion.
