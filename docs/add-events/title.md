## Titles for Theme Events
If a story time (or other regularly recurring event) will have an “in-house” special theme (i.e., not an outside special guest or performer), e.g., for Artober or Father’s Day, always include the regular recurring event name. Append special theme name to regular event name, following a colon.

- :white_check_mark: Teen Time: Make a Valentine’s Day Card

## Story Times with Special Performers
Story times with special performers do NOT include the story time title, to ensure consistency across locations for searching and scanning, and so that we don’t bury the lead.
