# Title

-	Whenever possible, use titles and descriptions from past events in the web calendar.
-	Do not use special characters (& ` ~ @) in titles.

## Naming Events
Make your titles clear. Give names context: make it obvious what will happen at the event.
- Add context to titles

## Abbreviations, Acronyms, Spelling
- Avoid overuse of abbreviations and acronyms: If event title has a lot of acronyms, rewrite it.

    - :x: GED for EL by TCAT
- Avoid cutesy misspellings and grammatically incorrect titles, e.g.  "Kraft Korner," "Krayon Kids," "Game Daze".

## Capital Letters
- Do not write titles using all capital letters, e.g., use “Teen Time”, not “TEEN TIME”.
- Do not use all capital letters for emphasis (e.g., “Come for FREE meditation sessions!” or “Teen Time TOO”). Reserve all capitals for acronym usage (e.g., STEAM, TOTAL).

## Titles for Theme Events
If a story time (or other regularly recurring event) will have an “in-house” special theme (i.e., not an outside special guest or performer), e.g., for Artober or Father’s Day, always include the regular recurring event name. Append special theme name to regular event name, following a colon.

## Story Times with Special Performers
Story times with special performers do NOT include the story time title, to ensure consistency across locations for searching and scanning, and so that we don’t bury the lead.
