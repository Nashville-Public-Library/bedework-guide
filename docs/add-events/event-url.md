#  Event URL
-	If reservations are required and patrons must register online, put the online registration link here.
-	If you need to take online registration, contact Web Services for access to NPLâ€™s Eventbrite or other online registration accounts.
-	You may also use this field to add a URL for a Facebook event.

## NPL Universe / Online
- Add the URL for where the user can watch the program
    - Branch Facebook videos page, not the specific video/live stream single link.
    - Specific YouTube playlist where video can be seen after initial airing.

## Warning: Do not use Address Bar link
- The URL present in the address bar for a given event detail is not specific to that event view. In essence, the calendar is one giant interactive webpage, and you are just shifting what part you are seeing by clicking on the dates, filters, and events.
- In order to get the URL for a specific event, go to the event list, then right-click on the hyperlink to the event, and copy the URL to your clipboard. Paste into text editor, or wherever you want to save the link. It will be a very long string.
- This is a [known bug](https://github.com/Bedework/bedework/issues/62) in the software, and we hope to see it resolved someday.
