# Before You Begin
- Always check the events calendar before adding an event to make sure the event is not already listed.
- Only add events to Bedework if they are confirmed.
- Add recurring events in three month periods matching the _Unbound_ publishing cycle (Dec Jan Feb, Mar Apr May, Jun Jul Aug, Sept Oct Nov).
    -	For example, if you have a story time that happens every Wednesday, you'll add that event to Bedework as 4 recurring events (one DecJanFeb listing, one MarAprMay listing, one JunJulAug listing, and one SepOctNov listing).
    - Approvers will approve events for the current and upcoming quarters. We will wait to approve events for the next unbound cycle until the current _Unbound_ cycle is complete.
