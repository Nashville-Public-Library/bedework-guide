# Clear Notifications
(the numbers by the envelope in admin client)

1.	Log in to Bedework (events or steven) as admin (superuser).
2.	Visit [https://events.library.nashville.org/caladmin/notify/removeAll.do](https://events.library.nashville.org/caladmin/notify/removeAll.do) - visiting the URL clears the notifications.
3.	After you visit that url, you don't get routed anywhere (you're just kind of looking at an empty screen). To get back to the calendar, back up your browser to [https://events.library.nashville.org/caladmin](https://events.library.nashville.org/caladmin) to continue working.
