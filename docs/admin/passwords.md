# Users and Passwords
Adding users to Events is a two step process. The admin client doesn't know anything about what you're doing in the jmx-console.

It's the difference between authentication (which is whether you can log in or not) and authorization (whether you allowed to administer the system). The jmx-console is handling authentication. Adding users to the superuser list or adding them to an admin group handles authorization.

 Add them in the jmx-console and then visit the admin client and add them to an admin group.

Deleting users cleanly is also a two step process. If you succeed in removing the user in the jmx-console, then the user won't be able to log in at all. So, you've removed a user via the jmx-console, they'll be shut out of the system. To keep things orderly, remember to remove the user from Bedework Users groups as well.
