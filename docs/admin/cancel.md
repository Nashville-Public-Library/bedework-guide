# Cancel or Reschedule

There are few instances where we will actually delete a listing from the events calendar. In most cases, we mark events canceled instead of deleting them.

## Canceling Events
-	Select “canceled” radio button.
-	Replace description with “This event is canceled” or some other brief explanation.

## Deleting Events
-	You CAN delete events from the calendar in the following instances:
-	Duplicate entries - If an event listing is a duplicate, delete the extra instance.
-	Holidays / Closed Days -
-	Approving events - Approvers should delete all event listings that fall on holidays / closed days before approving.
-	Prior to Exporting Pixie Dust - Delete all events that fall on holidays / closed days before exporting the final Pixie Dust document for back of book.
-	Do NOT delete an event in the following cases:
-	Event canceled, event publicized in print. Instead, mark the event canceled.
-	Closed day. - Even if the event falls on a holiday, if the event is published in print, leave the event in the calendar and mark it canceled.

## Rescheduled Events
-	If event was canceled and has been rescheduled, leave the original marked canceled and create a new event. If the canceled event is still in the future, note the new date/time in the description of the original canceled listing.

## Extended Closure
During the period when we are NOT offering any in-person events, we will do the following:
1.	Delete in-person events from Bedework for the affected period. We will no longer mark these as canceled.
1.	Add a single event to Bedework for each affected day. Event title will be “CANCELED: In-Person Library Events Canceled”
1.	Add virtual event offerings to Bedework. Staff should follow event listing guidelines that have been newly-added to NPL Style Guide and Bedework User Manual.
During the period when we offer both in-person AND streaming events, we will do the following:
1.	Mark canceled in-person events in Bedework as “canceled.”
1.	When canceling an event, put “Canceled:” at the start of the event title. This will ensure that patrons looking at calendar widgets will see that an event is canceled.

## Cancel or Update

When do we mark an event canceled vs just updating the existing event listing with new info? No different than usual.

- Room Change: If an event moves from in-person to online and date/time is the same, we’ll update the existing event listing to add virtual event details so patrons can connect. Essentially, the “room” changed from IN to Facebook. For this to work, we need “online” or “virtual” somewhere in the title.
- Canceled: If the event is totally canceled and isn’t just moving online, we’ll mark the event canceled.
- Time Change Only: If an event moves from in-person to online and the date is the same but the time changes, we update the existing event listing with new info.
- Date Change (or Date/Time both change): If an event moves to a different dayIf an event moves from in-person to online and the date/time is different (or event moves to a different time or day).
